# Vision Statement

Create a responsive and interpretive environment for fellow students to explore cyber security concepts and ideas. Participants will solve Linux based puzzles regarding a multitude of major cyber security concepts (including but not limited to cryptography, steganography, web exploitation, cli commands, binary exploitation and much more) and then apply them in a scenario based challenge.
